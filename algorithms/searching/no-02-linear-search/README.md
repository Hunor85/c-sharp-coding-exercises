# Linear Search

## Problem: Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

### A simple approach is to do linear search:
* Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
* If x matches with an element, return the index.
* If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables allow significantly faster searching comparison to Linear search.
